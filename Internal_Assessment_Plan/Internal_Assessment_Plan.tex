\section{Introduction}
The role of the Assessor is to perform an assessment of the software developed during the project openETCS. According to the standard EN 50128 and the software
safety integrity level (SIL4) of the project, it is very important to remind that the Assessor shall be independent from the project and shall be given
authority to perform the software assessment. Then, the Assessor shall not be part of project stakeholders, and is totally independent from the project teams.
Furthermore, the Assessor shall have the knowledge of both ERTMS and ETCS, of the dependability and of the standard EN 50128, even if only the On Board Unit EVC
Software takes part in the project scope.
\\
For these reasons, the need of an internal assessment has been identified at the beginning of the project. This activity would simulate a real external
assessment process, that would be enhanced by people being part of the openETCS project. This addresses the two main aspects of this task:
the technical knowledge on the ETCS OBU and the technical independency regarding the whole software development and project activities.

\subsection{Project context}
The aim of the internal assessment is to simulate a real assessor activity regarding a usual Railway signaling system development by a railway company. The openETCS project main objectives are:
\begin{itemize}
\item Transforming of higher-level, informal (i.e. expressed in natural language) ETCS requirements in formal requirements that will be used for
validation and verification activities of embedded control systems.
\item Adapting of modeling languages such that train control systems can be designed in suitable formalisms and verified against ETCS requirements in early
design phases.
\item Integrating and developing formal and semi-formal validation and verification techniques in order to prove the correctness of train control systems
against formalized ETCS requirements.
\item Generating symbiotic effects of large companies, R\&D institutes, and SMEs in order to bring together all relevant experts in the field taking advantage
from their diverse knowledge within a value adding chain (so called “eco-system” or “Co-Competition”).
\end{itemize}

These four objectives are all related to specific steps of On Board Unit Software development of the European Vital Computer (EVC). Moreover, they all encompass
underneath performance, reliability, availability, maintainability and safety objectives, that are usually translated into a Safety Integrity Level (SIL), and
the conditions regarding quality, process and overall development activities are gathered in the CENELEC standards EN50128 \cite{EN50128}, EN50126
\cite{EN50126} and EN50129 \cite{EN50129}.
Therefore, apply the common development strategy for such a railway system makes sense, and allows the project to base the whole EVC Software development on
existing CENELEC standards for such Railway signaling systems. Thus, it will allow us to meet these both conditions on design process and Safety Level.

\subsection{Internal Assessment Plan objectives}
This document provides the overall assessment plan and objectives that will be followed in the frame of internal assessment activities.
The activities are shared according to the main software development categories and deal with:
\begin{itemize}
\item Project and Software Quality assurance
\item Verification \& Validation
\item Safety
\end{itemize}

For each activity, this assessment plan identifies the relevant deliverables, and the criteria that will be considered for the assessment.
The Internal Assessment Plan assumes that: 
\begin{itemize}
\item All versions of the present Assessment Plan and modification tracking are provided in the document history.
\item Author of this document are Fr\'ed\'erique Vall\'ee (All4tec) and Norbert Sch\"afer (AEbt) as Internal Assessors for openETCS project.
\item Main reviewers of this document are:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Marc Behrens (DLR), as V\&V leader for openETCS project;
	\item Jan Welte (TU Braunschweig), as Safety leader for openETCS project.
	\end{itemize}
\item Customer identification is not needed.
\item Mission context (product description, context regarding the existing assessment of tools or artifacts in the project) is given.
\item The Product and Process assessment scopes are known.
\item The standards to be applied for Assessment are the CENELEC EN50126 \cite{EN50126} , EN50128 \cite{EN50128} and EN50129 \cite{EN50129} Standards.
\end{itemize}

According to the CENELEC standards, the Independent External Assessor is not allowed to be of the same organization in relation to the other roles contributing
to the project results.
This point is major because it defines precisely the difference between the Internal Assessment Task and the real assessment according to the CENELEC EN50128.
In our case, the people taking part in the Internal Assessment are not necessarily form outside of the organization, and are moreover part of the project
directly contributing to it. In addition the assessor shall have acceptance/licence from a recognised safety authority.

\newpage
\section{Project Quality Assessment}
This chapter details what are the main features to be checked regarding the quality assurance regarding the whole openETCS activities, from the very beginning
of the project to the end of it.
The Safety Criteria are defined in the document D2.2 appendix B3, and these criteria will be checked during the Internal Assessment reviews. The main points to
be assessed are:
\begin{itemize}
\item The Quality Assurance Plan (QAP) completeness
\item The Project Deliverables compliance with QAP
\item The Management and Responsibilities management 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Applicable Standards}
The compliance to the applicable standards is a major point for the quality management system assessment.
The major standards to be considered within openETCS are:
\begin{itemize}
\item CENELEC EN 50126 \cite{EN50126},
\item CENELEC EN 50128 \cite{EN50128} and
\item CENELEC EN 50129 \cite{EN50129}.
\end{itemize}

So far, the three standards have been identified as defining the normative frame for the EVC Software development. Due to the scope of the development as described inside the FPP \cite{FPP} only the CENELEC EN 50128 is applicable for the assessment.

\subsection{Quality Assurance Plan - QAP}
The purpose of the QA Plan is to define the processes, methods and tools that will be used to develop the openETCS project meeting ITEA requirements, following
Open Source principles and practices and applying the SCRUM Methodology. Besides, two of the project outcomes, the openETCS software, the openETCS Tool Chain,
will have to comply with CENELEC requirements.

The following aspects of quality will be precisely checked by the assessor, whether they belong to the QAP document or to other documents.
\begin{itemize}
\item openETCS development process. This process describes the whole documentation to be issued in the framework of openETCS project, and the connections
between the project inputs, the project outcomes, and the work packages and tasks identified in the project. The consistency between the IO documents and
informations identified in the development process and the related document content will be checked.
\item openETCS tool development process, depending of the tool usage and leve of qualification required (T1, T2 and T3). This process has to be described as
precisely as the Quality Assurance related to the EVC Software development activity. The verifications and assessments activities that will be performed on
this software development process are described in paragraph 5 of the plan.
\item Configuration Management Plan. This Configuration Management Plan has to consider each outcomes of the project from its very first release version to end
of the document whole life-cycle. The documentation change management related to the toolchains definitions or related to the EVC software development have
to be considered for both aspects of openETCS project development. This configuration management plan shall consider documentation changes but also toolchain,
model and code issued in the frame of openETCS project.
\item Review Process. The review process has to be applied from the very beginning of the project to its end.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Project Deliverables compliance with QAP}
The Safety Criteria are defined in the document D2.2, and these criteria will be checked during the Internal Assessment review. The main points to be assessed
for the project deliverables are:
\begin{itemize}
\item the documentation compliance for Software Safety Integrity Level 4. This includes for instance: architecture of the system, a functional and interface description of the system, the
application conditions, the configuration, the hazards to be controlled, the safety integrity requirements and the timing constraints.
\item the Requirements for tools class T1, T2 and T3. Tools have been identified so far for each category (text editor, requirements support, configuration
support tool for T1, static code analyzers, model checkers, model based testing tools, simulators for T2, and compilers or code generation tools for T3), and
all proof of compliance with the CENELEC standard and justification for use will be checked within internal assessment activities. This point is developed in
paragraph 5 of the plan.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Project Development Process}
The Project Development Process is a major point of the Quality Management System. It describes the overall project process, from the very first inputs used in
the project, the whole activities that are going to be performed and the corresponding outcomes to be issued, until the final deliverables of the project. The
inputs/outputs of each task, within a work package or a specific task, as well as the interfaces between all these tasks and activities, have to be described in
this process description.
The documents have to be identified in this process, and the connection  between the activities to be performed and the related documents shall be provided.

Documents or information related to some points of this process are of major importance for the assessor. Here is a list of technical items that should be more deeply examined by the assessor:
\begin{itemize}
\item The Architecture definition;
\item The Software components, with their functional interfaces (internal and external);
\item The functions and sub-functions of the software;
\item The Safety Requirements traceability;
\item The consistency of applied technics and methods to the Quality Assurance Plan.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{The Role and Responsibilities management}
The Quality Assurance in openETCS has to demonstrate that all the persons involved in the project have the sufficient skills and competencies to fulfill their
responsibilities. All these competencies have to be gathered and tracked whether in the QAP or in a separate quality related document that has to be identified
in the QAP.
According to the CENELEC EN50128, the 9 software development key roles to be identified are:
\begin{itemize}
\item the Requirements Manager,
\item the Designer,
\item the Implementer,
\item the Tester,
\item the Verifier,
\item the Integrator,
\item the Validator,
\item the Project Manager and
\item the Configuration Manager.
\end{itemize}

The information needed in Quality Assurance documentation is:
\begin{itemize}
\item The Actual Competencies Matrix of each committer in the project, linked to the work packages and the tasks they are involved in.
\item The Needed Competencies Matrix for each task, document and project outcomes. Each people contribution as to be as detailed as possible (at least the
contribution to a precise task or outcome).
\item From the gap identified between actual competencies matrix and required competencies matrix, a Training plan has to be set up for all the commiters of the
openETCS project. This plan will have to track all the identified needs, and then the solutions chosen in order to harmonize the competencies needed and the
committer's skills (training session, re-organization, role split, task force re-enforcement, etc...).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Quality Log and Traceability}
In the framework of assessment activities, all discrepancies related to Quality Assurance whatever the level considered, shall be gathered in a table called the
Quality Log. This log will be used by the Assessor as a list of possible or required improvements, to be used as a roadmap in order to get rid of all quality
assurance concerns or discrepancies identified during the whole project life cycle.
The Quality Log table shall encompass the following information: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Number of the log row,
\item Document/ Outcome concerned and precise discrepancy localization,
\item Document/ Outcome version,
\item Date,
\item Discrepancy description by assessor, and comments (assessor, author or else),
\item Action planned to fix (commonly defined by at least the document author and the assessor),
\item Action Deadline and
\item Status of the log (fixed, under investigation...)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Deliverable}
One deliverable will be issued in the frame of this part of internal assessment activity: The Project Quality Assurance Assessment Report. This deliverable will present the results of the overall quality assessment for the project.

\section{V\&V Assessment}
This chapter details what are the main features to be checked regarding the Verification and Validation (V\&V) activities regarding the whole openETCS software
development activities, from the very beginning of the project to the end of it.
The Quality Criteria regarding V\&V activities are defined in the document D2.2 appendix B4, and these criteria will be checked during the Internal Assessment
review. The main points to be assessed are:
\begin{itemize}
\item V\&V Plan,
\item Verification \& Validation activities for Primary Toolchain,
\item Verification \& Validation activities for Model,
\item Verification \& Validation activities for Code and
\item Safety.
\end{itemize}
%These activities are recorded in the following outcomes so far:
%\begin{itemize}
%\item  
%\end{itemize}

\subsection{V\&V Plan}
The purpose of the V\&V Plan is to define, describe and plan the verification and validation activities in the project openETCS. As the goals of the project
include the selection, adaption and construction of methods and tools for a FLOSS development in addition to performing actual development steps, the V\&V plan
will deal separately with these two aspects.
The Verification Plan for the model should describe the selection of verification strategies and techniques to be applied in openETCS for Testing the openETCS Semi-Formal Model (higher level architecture defined with SCADE System- SysML) and Formal Model (low level architecture and source code defined with SCADE Suite). The set of techniques, the definition of the process for test creation, test coverage and completeness, and roles in
the testing team will be assessed in the same way than for the Quality Assurance Aspects.
The Verification Plan for the tool is based on the CENELEC compliance for the qualified tools T1, T2 and T3. The Assessment will focus on quality assurance and
traceability of the verification.

The Validation Plan aims to give a frame to Validation activities to be performed within the openETCS project. It aims at determining whether the developed tool
fits the user needs, in particular with respect to safety and quality relatively to the environment it will be run in.
The Validation plan shall describe the validation strategy for both primary and secondary toolchains and for the EVC Software \footnote{By EVC Software we mean the productive output to EVC, i.e. SCADE code generated by the SCADE Model + manual written code.} to be developed as well. The
documentation shall be provided on techniques and tools used and on environment description. The assessment will focus on the coverage of artifacts to be
covered within the openETCS project validation plan, and the consistency between the Validation outcomes description in the plan and the effective Validation
activities performed in the Frame of openETCS project.

\subsection{Verification and Testing Activities}
The first aspect is related to the Verification activities. The Assessment for Verification will mainly concern the following points:
\begin{itemize}
\item Evidence
\item Test Specifications. The Test Specifications will have to fulfill the CENELEC requirements regarding the tests objectives, the precise content of the test
in terms of environment handling, data and expected results. Their consistency with the test policy will be checked and assessed.
\item Test Reports. The test reports will have to report as precisely as possible the information related to the test performance. The test results are compared
with the expected results defined during the test specification, failures have to be recorded, described and then investigated. The test environment such as
Tester names and test conditions have to be clearly described as well.
\end{itemize}
The Final reports of the Verification and Testing activities have to be integrated in the Quality Assurance Verification report, in order to prove the
consistency of the Verification activities with the CENELEC Standards.

\subsection{Validation Activities}
The second aspect is related to the Validation Activities. The Assessment for Validation will mainly concern the following points:
\begin{itemize}
\item The creation of a Validation Plan in order to define a frame for Validation activities (as described in previous paragraph);
\item The creation of a Validation Report. This report should describe the toolchain, the model or the code tested by functional approach, provide the results
of validation activities and provide the analysis and the identified discrepancies between expected and actual results. All discrepancies detected and/or
treated shall be gathered in the Software Validation Report.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{V\&V log and traceability for Model}
The V\&V activities can be split in testing activities and verification activities. The testing activities aim at verifying the Model behavior and performances
against the corresponding software specification, in order to achieve the objectives for the EVC Kernel Software Model.
For each test, a Test Specification has to be issued and will have to fulfill the CENELEC requirements regarding the tests objectives, the precise content of
the test in terms of environment handling, data and expected results. Their consistency with the test policy will be checked and assessed. At the end of the
test, a test report is then created. The consistency between the Test specification and the Test Results is then gathered and analyzed in the V\&V documents.
The internal Assessment will not focus on the Verification activity itself (which is dealt with in the frame of Verification and Validation activities), but on
the following assessment activities:
\begin{itemize}
\item The consistency between the tests to be performed, and the coverage of the functional requirements by these tests;
\item The traceability between the tests and the requirements;
\item The robustness of the  methods employed and their compliance to the CENELEC Standards;
\item The fulfillment of V\&V results according to the expected results defined in the V\&V plans.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{V\&V log and traceability for Code}
V\&V activities on code will have to take place, mainly in order to complete the coverage of the Model Verification and Validation activities. Indeed,
requirements that are not covered at the sub-system level will have to be highlighted in the Code Verification activity, whatever their content.
The internal assessment activity will focus on the coverage of:
\begin{itemize}
\item The method and process used to fill this log, and the accordance to the CENELEC EN50128;
\item The tools supporting the process for V\&V at Code level;
\item The fulfillment of the V\&V log, regarding all the information needed in order to track the issues raised during the V\&V activities;
\item The traceability aspect between the V\&V documentation issued in the frame of V\&V activities, and the V\&V log.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Deliverable}
One deliverable will be issued in the frame of this part of internal assessment activity: The V\&V Assessment Report. This deliverable will present the results
of the overall Verification and Validation assessment for the project.

\section{Safety Activities Assessment}
The Safety Activity is particularly relevant to be assessed, as a necessary condition to develop and supply a SIL4 EVC Software. The Safety Strategy defined
within the WP4 activities for openETCS project assumes that the overall Safety activities in the openETCS project will be performed and will cover the full software development life-cycle.
The overall Safety Activities shall be described in the openETCS Safety Plan.

\subsection{Safety Evaluation Criteria}
The Safety Evaluation Criteria that will be considered for the Internal Assessment are described in the Safety Criteria deliverable D2.2. These criteria will be
checked during the V\&V phases, but will also be reviewed in the Frame of Internal Assessment.
The main criteria to be assessed are:
\begin{itemize}
\item The method and process for Safety Activities, from Safety Plan to the whole Safety Case, and their consistency with the CENELEC;
\item The tools supporting the process and the method;
\item The traceability between the software development process and the Safety related documents;
\item The coverage of Safety requirements by V\&V activities at different levels (System,  sub-System, model, code) on Safety functions and components.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Safety Documentation Assessment}
The main Safety related documents to be assessed are:
\begin{itemize}
\item The Preliminary Risk Assessment (this document initiates the Safety log).
\item The System and Sub-System Safety Study. These points have to be clearly defined and connected according to the software design steps defined in the openETCS process. The following points are especially relevant for:
	\begin{itemize}
\item The transformation method from the Sub-System model (meta-model in MDD) to the Software model (COTS, branching, refinement and code generation algorithms
and options);
\item The Software components refined from the sub-system model (components description and version, components traceability, SIL level, traceability for safety
requirements traceability);
	\item The compiling toolchain analysis (COTS, branching of the software, the compilation options and scripts for compile or integrate);
	\item The Safety Requirements;
	\item The software configuration management (version, date, developers, etc...);
	\item The critical parameters, within the following :
		\begin{itemize}
		\item Common parameters for whatever the train or the trackside to be considered,
		\item Interlocking parameters,
		\item Fault data and fall-back positions.
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
\item The Code Safety Analysis activities:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item The code metrics analysis,
	\item The Function call graph Analysis,
	\item The Safety Requirements traceability,
	\item The SEEA (Software Errors and their Effects Analysis) for the whole code generated,
	\item The CCR (Critical Code Review) for the Safety related functions.
	\end{itemize}
\item The Safety V\&V activities:
	\begin{itemize}
\item The Verification activities on the transformation method from the system model to the sub-system model (bugs on process, side files needed, terminology
consistency, proof on formalized properties);
	\item The verification activities on the compilation toolchain (compilation bugs, side files generated, memories mapping, comparison of compiling options);
	\item Test plan and test reports on the software components.
	\end{itemize}
\item The Safety log, filled during the whole project duration. The main information to be assessed is:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item The coverage for all hazardous situation identified during the project;
\item The list of all Safety tickets or corrective actions performed in the frame of safety activities, and their status regarding the Safety property or issue
related.
	\end{itemize}
\item The Global Safety requirements coverage. A document should gather all the Safety requirements identified since the very beginning of the project. All
the concerns encountered during the very beginning of the Safety activities should be gathered too, and then linked to the solutions identified and applied, in
order to get rid of the concern.
\end{itemize}

All these documents constitute the Global Safety Case, and are a relevant set of documentation to be evaluated by the assessor. The Global Safety Case is
analyzed, with the verification that all risks identified in the Hazard log have been covered, and that external constraints (exported constraints) are
precisely defined.


\subsection{Deliverable}
One deliverable will be issued in the frame of this part of internal assessment activity: The Safety Assessment Report. This deliverable will present the
results of the overall Safety assessment for the project.

\subsection{Detailed tool assessment}
According to the CENELEC there are 3 different classes of tools, leading to specific assessment for each tool class. According to the D2.2 document, the tool
Assessment for the project toolchain will focus on different aspects according to the role and the category of each tool proposed for the project. The tool
category definition is described in \S 2.3 of this document.

The Safety Criteria for tools are defined in the document D2.2 appendix A, and these criteria will be checked during the Internal Assessment reviews. 

\subsection{Intermediate Evaluation Assessment}
The Internal Assessment activities is supposed to improve the openETCS project compliance with a standard need of Assessment for such a SIL4 Software.
Therefore, different activities related to the assessment have to be performed during the on-going process of Software development. These actions can be performed in different ways:

\begin{itemize}
\item Intermediate Reports. These reports will be triggered at specific time/issue of the project, as described in §6.1. They will be based on a pre-defined set
of documentation defined in accordance with documentation authors and coordinators, and gathered in a specific GitHub repository. Then, Assessor's remarks will
be gathered as issues related to these specific audits. These issues will then be gathered in the Internal Assessment Backlog, document to be integrated as an
appendix of final Assessment Report Evaluation.
\item Audits. These Audits will be triggered if specific points are detected as critical during an intermediate Evaluation Assessment. These Audits will be
described and documented in specific GitHub Repository. Audits description (object, reason, context, actions, validation by assessment) will be supported by the
GitHub issue facility, and gathered in the Internal Assessment backlog.
\item Meeting minutes. These meetings can be triggered by a specific need highlighted during an intermediate evaluation or an audit. The associated minutes
would then be hosted in a specific GitHub Repository, and then gathered the Internal Assessment Backlog.
